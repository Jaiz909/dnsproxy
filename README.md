tunlr-style-dns-unblocking
==========================

Since Tunlr.net closed down unexpectedly this week, I decided to publish my ideas and findings on the subject of DNS unblocking. I used Tunlr for some time when I decided to develop my own, private DNS unblocking solution last year.

I also included a "poor man's" DNS unblocking sample configuration using just a single IP address. This should work fine with SNI-capable web browsers/devices but totally won't work with non-SNI-capable devices.
